          IIT Mandi especially encourages girls to join our B.Tech. programme.
          Engineering is a profession dedicated to developing solutions for the
          problems of society. As half of society is female, it is only by
          having a large number of female engineers that our society will get
          the best solutions. From excelling in science subjects in high school
          to heading world-renowned hi-tech companies such as HP and Xerox,
          women have proved themselves as highly talented engineers. On this
          page, some of our female faculty members and B.Tech students tell you
          why IIT Mandi is a special place for them. We have special incentives
          for female B.Tech. students at IIT Mandi.

                I am currently pursuing my 4th semester of B.Tech. in Electrical
                Engineering in IIT Mandi and still every morning I am a newborn
                amidst the range of mountains, crowning fluffy white clouds and
                the Uhl river flowing through the feet of these mountains. My
                first experience of these mighty mountains, this excited river
                and those puffy white clouds was some sort of a heavenly
                daydream. Throughout my way to the campus, this mesmerizing
                sight was getting more and more magical. Then, I found the very
                welcoming team of my seniors of Guidance and Counseling Services
                (GCS). They escorted me to my hostel. This was my first time to
                the hostel life , so I was very scared about this new challenge.
                Then, we had interaction with our Director. He was so welcoming.
                We even had our snacks with him. The next day started the 5 Week
                Induction Program with the morning exercises. 5WIP is the
                fanciest part of this journey. After 5WIP, we were introduced to
                the course curriculum. Even today, we can approach our seniors
                anytime (yes, there is no form of ragging). Sometimes, even now,
                our Director comes to our mess to have meal with us and talk
                about our life and career choices, our learning experiences.
                Today when I look back, I find myself more developed, more
                socialised and less occupied with that 5 inch screen. That couch
                potato can now run for 2 and half kilometers. I owe you IIT
                Mandi.
